/*
In a real-time system, there is a need to make the allocation/free of blocks of memory of
certain size happens in a deteministic time. Design and implement such a memory
allocator. The memory allocator will manage a pool of blocks of fixed size. When
allocation is requested, the allocator would return a block at a time. The user
can free the allocated block by returning it back to the allocator.

The allocator manages a certain number of blocks and doesnâ€™t grow beyond this
number. The system can have multiple allocators each of its own fixed block size
and its own max block count.

/*Ex: Ask for 5 bytes with 3 byte alignment
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
Malloc returns 04
The function needs to return 06
Free at 04
