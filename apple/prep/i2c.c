/*
Question: You are working on a project to develop firmware for a new sensor module 
that communicates with an Apple device over I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol. 
The sensor module provides temperature and humidity data. You need to implement a 
function to read data from the sensor and convert it into meaningful temperature and 
humidity values. Additionally, you should handle error conditions gracefully.

Please provide the function signature and the implementation for reading and converting 
the sensor data, taking into consideration error handling and data conversion accuracy.

Write a C function in embedded firmware that accomplishes this task. 
Assume that the I2C communication functions (e.g., i2c_read_byte, i2c_write_byte) 
are already provided by the hardware abstraction layer.

#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t i2c_read_byte(uint8_t device_address, uint8_t register_address){

}

uint8_t get_sensor_value(uint8_t device_address, uint8_t register_address){
    uint8_t dev_val = 0;
    dev_val = i2c_read_byte(device_address, register_address);
    return dev_val;
}
