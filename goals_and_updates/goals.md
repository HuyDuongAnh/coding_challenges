2.  Potential paths he suggested include:
    1.  Continue to study and apply with current career path 
    2.  Get a master and hopefully by the graduating time, the job market is covered

    3.  Get a certificate that would help me get into IT (This route may get me the 
    low paid job, but it can help with paying for my tuition if I want to advance further).
