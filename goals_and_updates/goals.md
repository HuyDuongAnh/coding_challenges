**Marady's tips**
1.  Identify my career path (people said this a lot, but not many are able to achieve it)
2.  Potential paths he suggested include:
    1.  Continue to study and apply with current career path 
    2.  Get a master and hopefully by the graduating time, the job market is covered 
    (This route may cost me money and has a lot of uncertainties).
    3.  Get a certificate that would help me get into IT (This route may get me the 
    low paid job, but it can help with paying for my tuition if I want to advance further). 
    4.  Going into job career at Cal Poly in Winter Quarter and get a sense of how the market.
    5.  Going to on-site job search locally.
    6.  Personally reach out to job recruiter after applying for a position
